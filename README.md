Golf - named after the popular recreational computer programming
competition in which programmers try to solve a problem using as
few characters as possible.  These sets of functions and classes
provide shortcuts for popular  activities such as reading in and
parsing lines of text from a file or the terminal. Combined with
Scala's simplicitiy many challenging problems can be rendered in
suprisingly little code.
